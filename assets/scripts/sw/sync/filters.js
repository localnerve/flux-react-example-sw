/**
 * Get latest of type and operation for each unique key or prop.
 * Requests are 'classified' by type and operation. Each classification can
 * belong to a unique key or alternatively, a unique property value.
 *
 * Using Optional prop
 * The optional prop is supplied if the caller wants to not use fallback.key
 * to determine request uniqueness AND instead needs to use a custom property
 * value defined in the request body to determine request uniqueness within
 * one request type/operation (aka request 'class' or 'classification').
 *
 * Eliminating key uniqueness
 * Key can be removed from this filtering scheme altogether by making it always
 * the same value for a particular type/operation.
 *
 * Multiple Operations Set Input
 * If you supply multiple operations, the latest match in the op set will
 * win. Example: [subscribe, unsubscribe] will match the most recent of either
 * subscribe or unsubscribe. So, if there were a bunch of sub/unsub requests,
 * the last one will be the one that is replayed representing that 'class' of
 * request.
 *
 * TODO: Make fallback keys functional across request types
 * Practically, the key matching will only matter for contact requests, where the
 * 'key' is the replyToEmail. To make this also work for push type requests,
 * push subscription updates need to change all deferred requests' keys to the
 * new subscribeId as key AFTER the change is synchronized on the server.
 * subscription updates will have to take top priority (be processed first)
 * for 'push' type requests. While the priority ordering of push type requests
 * must remain (because an subscriptionId update changes everything and
 * the subscriptionId in the push request payloads of deferred requests will
 * need updating), the fallback.key complication could be avoided by just making
 * all push type requests use the same arbitrary key value
 * (like '9', for example), effectively removing the fallback key criterion
 * from push request types.
